## Features

A new component will be introduced in the Activity Bar called the *Crowdin*. The plugin will scan each workspace for a Crowdin-specific configuration file and will build a tree with source files.

### Sources and translations sync, tracking project progress

With this plugin you can:

- Upload files for translation to Crowdin.
- Download sources and translations from Crowdin.
- Track progress of translated and approved strings for each project and target language.

### String keys autocompletion

Use string keys in your code fetched from Crowdin and available in autocomplete suggestions. Whenever a user types something, the VSCode autocompletion will suggest available string keys from Crowdin.

There is a possibility to configure file extensions, where the string keys autocompletion will appear. By default, autocompletion is turned on and available in all files.

Strings for autocompletion are loaded during the bootstrap of VSCode and are also updated whenever there was a change in the `crowdin.yml` configuration file.

This gif illustrates the autocompletion of string keys in a React project that uses the [Lingui](https://lingui.dev/tools/crowdin) library.

## Setup

### Installation

Install the *Crowdin* plugin using one of the following methods:

- open VS Code Extensions (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>), search for *Crowdin* and click **Install**

     or

- launch VS Code Quick Open (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>), paste the below command, and press **Enter**
        ```
        ext install Crowdin.vscode-crowdin
        ```

### Authorization via browser

Run the following [commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) to prepare workspace:

- `Crowdin: Sign In` to log in into your Crowdin profile
- `Crowdin: Select Project` to select Crowdin project
- `Crowdin: Create configuration` to generate Crowdin configuration file
  - Edit `files` section according to your project needs

### Manual setup

- Create a new Personal Access Token in your Crowdin account settings.
- Get the Project ID in the Tools > API section on your Crowdin project page.
- Prepare a `crowdin.yml` configuration file and add it to the needed workspace in Visual Studio Code.

## Configuration

To work with the plugin in the Visual Studio Code workspace, there should be a Crowdin configuration file called either `crowdin.yml` or `crowdin.yaml`. The plugin scans each Visual Studio Code workspace to find a Crowdin configuration file and automatically builds the tree with source files in the *Crowdin* component available in your Activity Bar.

You can create a new configuration file by using the "Crowdin: Create configuration" command in the VS Code Command Palette (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>).

**Configuration file example:**

```yaml
"files": [
  {
    "source": "/sources/**/*.xml",
    "translation": "/translations/%two_letters_code%/%original_file_name%"
  }
]
```

**All supported options:**

```yaml
"project_id": "projectId" // optional
"api_token": "apiToken" // optional
"base_path": "folder" // optional
"branch": "master" // optional
"base_url": "https://{organization-name}.crowdin.com" // optional (for Crowdin Enterprise only)

"files": [
  {
    "source": "/sources/**/*.xml",
    "translation": "/translations/%two_letters_code%/%original_file_name%",
    "update_option": "update_as_unapproved", // optional
    "excluded_target_languages": ["uk", "fr"], // optional
    "labels": ["android", "emails"], // optional
    "dest": "/app/%file_name%.xml", // optional
    "type": "android" // optional
  },
  {
    "source": "multicolumn.csv",
    "translation": "multicolumn.csv",
    "scheme": "identifier,source_phrase,context,uk,ru,fr" // optional
  }
]
```

**Tip:** You don't need to specify the `project_id` and `api_token` in your configuration file if you use browser authorization in the plugin.

You can also use environment variables in the configuration file [Environment variables](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/#api-credentials-from-environment-variables):

```yaml
"project_id_env": "CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID"
"api_token_env": "CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN"
"base_path_env": "CROWDIN_BASE_PATH"
"base_url_env": "CROWDIN_BASE_URL"
```

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `crowdin.autoRefresh`: enable/disable auto refresh of the file tree after each change in the Crowdin configuration file.
- `crowdin.stringsCompletion`: enable/disable autocompletion of strings keys.
- `crowdin.stringsCompletionFileExtensions`: comma-separated list of file extensions for which autocomplete should be active. By default, strings autocomplete will be active in all files.
- `crowdin.useGitBranch`: enable/disable the use of a Git branch as a Crowdin branch.

## Limitations

At the moment, the plugin does not support all possible properties in the configuration file (see [Configuration file](https://support.crowdin.com/configuration-file/)). All properties which are supported by this plugin are listed in the example above.

## Configuration

To work with plugin in the Visual Studio Code workspace, there should be Crowdin configuration file called either `crowdin.yml` or `crowdin.yaml`.

Configuration file example:

```json
"project_id": "projectId"
"api_token": "apiToken"
"base_path": "folder" // optional
"branch": "master" // optional
"base_url": "https://{organization-name}.crowdin.com" // optional (not needed for non-enterprise usage)

"files": [
  {
    "source": "/sources/**/*.xml",
    "translation": "/translations/%two_letters_code%/%original_file_name%"
  }
]
```

Project ID can be found in your project settings page.

To generate a new API token in Crowdin, go to your Account Settings.

## Setup

1. Prepare `crowdin.yml` or `crowdin.yaml` configuration file and add it to the needed workspace in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install *Crowdin* plugin using one of the following methods:
    * open VS Code Extensions (**Ctrl+Shift+X**), search for *Crowdin* and click **Install**

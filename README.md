## Configuration

To work with plugin in the Visual Studio workspace, there should be Crowdin configuration file called either `crowdin.yml` or `crowdin.yaml`.

Configuration file example:

```json
"project_identifier": "projectId"
"api_key": "apiKey"
"base_path": "folder" // optional
"branch": "master" // optional

"files": [
  {
    "source": "/locale/en/folder1/[0-2].txt",
    "translation": "/locale/%two_letters_code%/folder1/%original_file_name%"
  },
  {
    "source": "/locale/en/folder2/[0-2].txt",
    "translation": "/locale/%two_letters_code%/folder2/%original_file_name%"
  }
]
```

Properties `project_identifier`, `api_key` can be found in your project settings page.

## Setup

1. Prepare `crowdin.yml` or `crowdin.yaml` configuration file and add it to the needed workspace in Visual Studio.
2. Install *Crowdin* plugin using one of the following methods:
